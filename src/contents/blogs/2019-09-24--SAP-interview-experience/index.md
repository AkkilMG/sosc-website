## Brief Intro About SAP Labs

SAP Labs India is a product company that is the forerunner in making Enterprise Solutions. SAP has been awarded as the best place to work multiple times. [Scholar@SAP](https://www.sap.com/india/about/careers/university-programs/students/vocational-training.html) is a globally recognized work integrated and learning program in partnership with [BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/). As a Scholar, you will have the opportunity to rotate across SAP business areas while receiving on-the-job and structured development and coaching from leaders in technology.

## Hiring Process

SAP Labs had four rounds in their hiring process. Let me walk you through each of them.

### Round 1

First round was the online test conducted in Hackerrank. The test had MCQs on time complexity, data structures, algorithms and database. And there were two coding questions. One of them was to sort the dates in ascending order and the other one was to print a given pattern.

From our college 10 people cleared the first round including me and I'm happy to say that 3 of them were from SOSC.:tada:

For the further rounds we had to go to the Alva's Institute of Engineering and Technology, Moodbidri. We had to assemble in the campus at 9am. There was pre-placement talk followed by three rounds of interview. First two rounds were technical and the third one was HR, and all of them were elimination rounds.

### Round 2

In the first round of interview I was asked which is my favourite subject. I told her it's OOP and then she told me to write down and explain the four pillars of OOP along with an example for each. Once I was done explaining she asked me about few of the points I had mentioned in my resume. In the end she asked me whether I have any questions for her and I asked her for the introduction. So I was done with first round of my interview.

Later they announced the results of first round and I was shortlisted for the next round.:smiley:

### Round 3

In the second round of interview which went on for 30-40 minutes I was asked to explain each and every point I had mentioned in my resume. He asked me to explain each of the projects I had mentioned in detail. After this I was asked to write a pseudocode to check whether the number of brackets in a given string is balanced or not. Then he gave me a table and told to write a SQL query to access certain tuples in the table. After this I was asked basic questions on networking like how to share files over FTP and how to detect a PC over the network. At the end he asked me a [puzzle](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-18-torch-and-bridge/), which I failed to answer.:sweat_smile:

But overall the interview went really well:blush: and I was able to answer most of the questions. So the interviewer told me that I can continue to the HR round.:heart_eyes:

### Round 4

The final round of interview started with a brief introduction about myself. There were two HR's in the panel and they gave a brief explanation about the Scholar@SAP program. They also asked me why I want to pursue higher studies and told me that there would be lot of pressure as I will have to manage both my academic and work, and asked me how I would tackle it. At the end I was told to wait for the results.

Around 8:30pm when we were on our way back we got the results and 5 from our college were selected including me and 2 were from SOSC.

## Why do I keep mentioning about SOSC?

In all the above rounds there was one common question. Yup, you guessed it right. Tell me about yourself. So whenever I introduce myself I used to mention that I am a part of open source community in our college and the conversation about SOSC would go on for next 5-10 minutes. Most of us are scared of interviews because we don't have enough content to talk during the interviews. So when we stop talking the interviewers will start asking a lot of questions.
So being a part of SOSC not just gave me enough content to talk but has improved my communication skills a lot by taking multiple workshops. And we have some pretty amazing seniors who are always ready to help. Community is a place where we all learn together and grow together and thats exactly what's happening in SOSC.

## Few tips to crack SAP Labs

1. SAP being a ERP company requires you to have a decent knowledge on DBMS.
2. Learn the Data Structures and OOP properly. Make sure you know atleast one of the OOP language.(C++ or Java preferred).
3. Having a good internship makes sure that you have good exposure to real world problems. Make sure you have worked on a good project during your internship period.
